# Task 03: Add a Cool Header

Now that we’ve got our HTML template ready, it’s time to start adding more tags, content, and even some images to make our website look amazing and super useful!

## Add An H1 Header Tag

Let’s kick things off by adding our very first header at the top of the page! We’ll use the `<h1></h1>` tag for this. The `<h1></h1>` tag is like the “main headline” of the webpage, so it’s perfect for making a big, bold statement.

Inside your `<header></header>` tag, add an `<h1></h1>` tag. Then, inside your new `<h1></h1>`, write an awesome, fun title for your page!

For example:

`<h1>My Awesome Website</h1>`
