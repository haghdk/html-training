# Let's make a website

In this "training" we will make a small website. What we are going to make can be seen [here](www.hagh.dk)

First we need an application to make our website. This type of application is called an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). For this task we will be using Visual Studio Code. It is a free IDE made by Microsoft. 
You can dowload it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or use a browser version [here](https://vscode.dev/)
