# Task 06: Adding A Text To The Footer

To wrap up our basic HTML template, let’s add the current year and our website name to the footer! The footer is usually where you put useful info like an address, social media links, or even a mini sitemap (a list of main links on your website).

## Add Text To The Footer
Inside the `<footer></footer>` tag, add a `<div></div>` tag. We’ll use this div to help style the content in our footer later.

Here’s what it looks like:

`<div></div>`

Now, inside your `<div></div>`, type in the current year, _2024_, and the name of your website. It can look something like this:

`<div>2024 - My Awesome Website</div>`
