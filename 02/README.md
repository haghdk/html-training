# Task 02: Let's Add Some Cool Tags to Our Webpage!

Great job building your first HTML structure! Now, let’s level up and add more tags to make our website look awesome and filled with good content. These new tags aren't "must-haves," but they help organize your content and make your page way cooler. Plus, when we start styling, you’ll see just how fun things can get!

## More HTML Tags!

Remember from the last task that most HTML tags come with a start tag and an end tag. It’s like opening and closing a treasure chest—but for code!

### The div tag

First up, inside the `<body>` tag, let’s add a `div` tag. This tag is like a container, or a box, that holds other pieces of your webpage. 

Write this in your code:
`<div></div>`

### The header tag

Now, inside your new `<div>` tag, write a `<header></header>` tag. This tag is like the top part of your webpage, where you can put things like a title, a navigation menu, or even a big, cool background image! We’ll add an image here later to make our site pop.

Write this in your code:
`<header></header>`

### The Main Tag

Right below your `</header>` tag, add a `<main></main>` tag. This tag is where the main content of your website will live. It’s like the main stage of a show — where all the action happens!

Write this in your code:
`<main></main>` 

### The Section Tag

Now, let’s get creative! Inside your `<main>` tag, add a `<section></section>` tag. Think of this as a mini-stage where you can put text, pictures, lists, and other fun stuff. Each section can have its own theme or topic.

It looks like this:
`<section></section>`

### Add Another Section Tag

Right after your newly created `<section></section>` tag, add another section tag, so that we now have two `<section></section>` tags we can use for some awesome content.

### The Footer Tag 

Finally, after your `</main>` tag, write a `<footer></footer>` tag. This tag is like the bottom part of your website. It’s where you can put things like your name, a copyright notice, or even some cool social media links. For now, we’ll keep it simple and use it to show the website name and the current year.

Write this:
`<footer></footer>`
