# Task 02

Now that we have build our necessary HTML, we can start writing more tags to make our website look nice and with good content. These tags a not necessary but are used to contain content and later we will use them to "style" our website.

## More tags

Remember in the previous intro task, that most HTML tags have a begin tag and an end tag.

### div tag

Inside the `body` tag, start by writing a `div` tag. 

`<div></div>`

### header tag

Inside the begin `<div>` tag, write a `<header></header>` tag. This tag, as the name suggest, is the header of our website. It has many uses, like for example a navigation bar, and intro text or a large background image. We will use it for a background image.

### main tag

Below the end `</header>` tag, write a `<main></main>` tag. This tag is used to contain the main content of our website. 

### section tag

Inside the `main` tag, write a `<section></section>` tag. This tag defines a whole section of our website, for example a section with text, text and image, a list and much more.

### footer tag 

After the `<main></main>` tag, write a `<footer></footer>` tag. This tag is has many purposes and can be used to contain an address and phone number, links to social media, a copyright text and so on. We will use it to display our website name and the current year.
